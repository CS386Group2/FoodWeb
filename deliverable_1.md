## Introduction

    foodWeb is an app designed to streamline the sharing and organizing of recipes for cooks, chefs, fitness enthusiasts, and food heads. We plan to make working with recipes simpler in every aspect. Often when you search for a recipe in google you are met with articles and ad walls that have nothing to do with the recipe you need. We will connect people via our app in order to turn using recipes into a more convenient and social experience.

## Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segment

    Consumer Segments: Anyone who cooks using recipes. 
	Value proposition:  Fast, easy, and accessible way to find, organize and share recipes.
